*Story*

Fairy Tail is a shounen manga series by Mashima Hiro that started August 23, 2006. A Fairy Tail anime, produced by A-1 Pictures and Satelight was created on October 12, 2009.

Fairy Tail follows the story of Lucy Heartfilia and the exploits of the wizard guild Fairy Tail. Lucy tends to team up with Dragon Slayer and fire wizard Natsu Dragneel, a talking blue cat named Happy, ice wizard Gray Fullbuster, and the most powerful female wizard in the guild, Erza Scarlet with the power of requipping her weapons and armor.

The guild Fairy Tail is named Fairy Tail because of the mystery of whether or not fairies have tails. From episode 1.27 The Two Dragon Slayers: "No one knows if fairies have tails or not, or even if fairies exist at all. Thus the name signifies eternal mystery, eternal adventure..." (Guild master Makarov Dreyar said to a young Natsu).
